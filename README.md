# DATA CONTROL PANEL

This repository contains code for a lab results dashboard. The dashboard provides an easy-to-use interface for viewing sample analysis results in a laboratory. It allows quick visualization of data, including the distribution of samples and assays over time, as well as detailed information on assay and sample values.

## Features

- **Segmentation by Month and Year:** Allows you to segment the data by month and year for a more detailed analysis.
- **Summary Cards:** Displays 5 cards with important analysis values, test times and samples for quick reference.
- **Bar Graphs:** Visualization of total samples and analyzes over time in the form of bar graphs.
- **Pie Charts:** Provides pie charts to show the distribution of samples and analysis.

## How does it work

The control panel uses laboratory data stored in a database. Summary cards update dynamically as data in the database changes along with charts.
